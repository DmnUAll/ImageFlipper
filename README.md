The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- UIActivityViewController
- UIImagePickerController
- UIAlertController
- UINavigationController
- Privacy Camera and Photo Library usage descriptions


At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design.\
All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
